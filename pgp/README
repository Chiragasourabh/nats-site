Drop the ASCII-armored `.asc` export of any OpenPGP keys for users or systems
with email addresses in the nats.io domain into this directory.

The build system will generate the right content in the
`.well-known/openpgpkey/` area of the web-site to support
<https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-koch-openpgp-webkey-service/>.

This enables commands such as the following to work, to allow the public to get
the signing key for our Java artifacts from a trusted source:

    gpg --locate-key info@nats.io

With sufficiently recent versions of gpg, `--locate-external-key` will force a
lookup even if the key exists on the local keyring, enabling refreshes:

    gpg --locate-external-key info@nats.io


Anyone with an email address in the `nats.io` domain can have a PGP key added here.

Beware that the build-system used for the production website might not have a
current version of the GnuPG command available and we can't do much about that;
as of 2020-08, we know that Ed25519 keys broke it.  Please stick to RSA keys
for now.
