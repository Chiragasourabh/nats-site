NATS is a connective technology built for the ever increasingly hyper-connected world.  It is a single technology that enables applications to securely communicate across any combination of cloud vendors, on-premise, edge, web and mobile, and devices.
NATS consists of a family of open source products that are tightly integrated but can be deployed easily and independently. NATS is being used globally by thousands of companies, spanning use-cases including microservices, edge computing, mobile, IoT and can be used to augment or replace traditional messaging.

The NATS Server acts as a central nervous system for building distributed applications. Client APIs are provided in over 40 languages and frameworks including Go, Java, JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Ruby, Rust, C#, C, and NGINX.  Real time data streaming, highly resilient data storage and flexible data retrieval are supported through [JetStream](https://docs.nats.io/jetstream/), the next generation streaming platform built into the NATS server.  Check out the full list of [NATS clients](/download).

NATS was created by Derek Collison, in response to the market need for a simple, secure, and connective technology. NATS is currently deployed in some of the largest cloud platforms, including: VMware, CloudFoundry, Baidu, Siemens, and GE. NATS is 100% free to use under the Apache-2.0 Open Source License.

NATS is unique in its simplicity and performance, and as a result powers some of the largest production environments. You can learn more about NATS in our [extensive documentation](https://docs.nats.io).
