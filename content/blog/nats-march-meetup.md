Hello everyone. It’s been a great start to 2016, and we didn’t want to go too long without hosting another NATS [meetup](http://www.meetup.com/NATS-Cloud-Native-Meetup/events/228039890/). Now that we are well past the holiday hangover, and into the conference and event season, before things get too busy we wanted to invite everyone out to our offices in the heart of San Francisco at [140 New Montgomery Street](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Apcera/@37.7867348,-122.4021031,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x8085807ce9d0a281:0x4ab320e35d2052d6).

On March 22nd, we will be hosting a NATS Meetup \(RSVP [here](http://www.meetup.com/NATS-Cloud-Native-Meetup/events/228039890/) if you can make it!\), and I am thrilled to have two excellent guest speakers from the NATS development community. Both [Tyler Treat](https://twitter.com/tyler_treat) and [John Lockwood](https://twitter.com/johnwlockwoodiv) work at Workiva; Workiva uses NATS as their cloud native microservices transport in their distributed systems infrastructure. If you are not already familiar with Tyler, he maintains the blog [Brave New Geek](http://bravenewgeek.com).

His blog has some excellent coverage of distributed systems, and messaging/integration in particular. He’s provided several popular \(and well debated\) articles on messaging queue benchmarks - be they latency or throughput - several of which we have shared with the NATS community via this site.

John Lockwood also blogs, and his post about his talk at the Python Meetup in January was recently featured in the Techcrunch piece about IoT messaging, which includes coverage of NATS \(last few paragraphs to wrap up the article\): [techcrunch.com/2016/03/01/iot-security-needs-scalable-solutions](http://techcrunch.com/2016/03/01/iot-security-needs-scalable-solutions/)

Tyler and John will give two very different talks, which will both showcase the simplicity and versatility of NATS. Tyler will discuss how he uses NATS at Workiva, while John will discuss using NATS for Secure IoT messaging. I am thrilled to hear both talks, and think anyone interested in Microservices, IoT, Cloud Native Applications, and Go in the Bay Area who can make it should join us.

The last meetup \(reminder below of some of the talks\) we held was a lot of fun, and we are looking forward to seeing you at the next one.

We will also be live-streaming the meetup, so if you are not able to attend in person, please join that way, and let us know your thoughts and questions via twitter:
