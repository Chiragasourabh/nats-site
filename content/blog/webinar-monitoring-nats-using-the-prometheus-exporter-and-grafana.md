Developers using NATS are looking for simplicity and performance in deploying their cloud native applications. As Prometheus and Grafana become increasingly popular, combining these technologies to monitor NATS has been a common request from our developer community. In May, we released a Prometheus exporter in beta. This webinar will give an overview of the exporter, and using this with Grafana for monitoring.
