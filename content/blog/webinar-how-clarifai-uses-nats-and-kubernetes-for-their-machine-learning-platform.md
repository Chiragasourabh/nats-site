**When:** Wednesday, May 10th at 3PM New York / 12PM San Francisco

Clarifai is a machine learning company which aims to make artificial intelligence accessible to the entire world. Their platform allows users to tap into powerful machine learning algorithms while abstracting away the technical minutiae of how the algorithms work and the infrastructure scaling problems of building AI applications from scratch.

Clarifai has moved to a highly available Kubernetes-based architecture, which also required a simple, scalable messaging layer. NATS was selected by the Clarifai team for a variety of reasons.

This webinar will provide more information on the Clarifai platform, how Kubernetes and NATS are used on the back-end, and we'll also have QnA at the end.
