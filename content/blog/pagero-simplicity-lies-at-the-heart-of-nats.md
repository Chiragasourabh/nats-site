From Kubecon in Copenhagen to Pagero in Gothenburg.

The NATS team was delighted to get an invitation from [Pagero](https://www.pagero.com/) to attend two of the [Gothenburg Tech Radar MeetUps](https://www.meetup.com/Gothenburg-Tech-Radar/) in Sweden following Kubecon + CloudNativeCon EU 2018. NATS Engineer, Waldemar Quevedo did double duty at the events. Check out Robin Morero's blog post about Wally's visit and why they have been watching NATS.
