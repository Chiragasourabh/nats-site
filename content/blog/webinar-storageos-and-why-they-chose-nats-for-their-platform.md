**Speaker:** Karolis Rusenas, Technical Lead at StorageOS

**When:** Wednesday, August 23rd at 1PM New York / 6PM London

StorageOS enables users to deploy database workloads inside containers and use local node storage without the fear of losing data and without frustration of slow disks.

Karolis Rusenas is the Tech Lead at StorageOS, and has been involved in developing the platform from the early days. StorageOS is a Golang based platform, and as a result makes use of popular Go tools - including NATS.

This webinar will feature an overview of the technology stack StorageOS and quick demo, as well as a conversation about where NATS fits in, and what is has enabled. We'll do QnA at the end, so bring a few questions along!
